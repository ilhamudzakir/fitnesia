   <h5 class="desc"><strong>How do I start working with Satuplatform?</strong></h5>
   <div class="content-faq">
       Satuplatform only accepts applications from selected companies.  We choose products based on their appeal to local markets, quality of the product, and its ability to localize price to different markets. The process is quite simple. We just simply need to agree to terms such as pricing and contract length. Once the contract is signed, we will start offering your product

   <h5 class="title">COST</h5>
   <h5 class="desc"><strong>How much does it cost to work with Satuplatform?</strong></h5>
   <div class="content-faq">
      One of the major benefits of working with Satuplatform is that there is no upfront cost to joining. Instead, Satuplatform charges a marketing fee for the promotion and customer support of your product. The specific marketing and support fee varies, based upon your industry and market, as well as consumer demand for your project.

   <h5 class="title">PRICING </h5>
   <h5 class="desc"><strong>How do we determine a reasonable price for your product?</strong></h5>
   <div class="content-faq">
      For your product to appeal to local markets, accurate localization where we charge differently in varying markets is a must. Our local industry experts will help you to come up with reasonable pricing strategy. For price adjustment you must wait until the contract, we have with existing customer expires, after that we can renegotiate the proper price adjustment if it is deemed necessary.

   <h5 class="title">PAYMENT</h5>
   <h5 class="desc"><strong>How does payment work?</strong></h5>
   <div class="content-faq">
   All payments will go through our account. After we receive the payment, we send funds to you. The amount or type of payment (recurring/lump sum) we make depends on which plan the consumer has chosen. For installment/recurring payments we will pay you monthly. Whereas, for lump sum payments, we will pay you after we receive the money from the customer.

      <div id="sec-faq">
   <h5 class="title">CONTRACT </h5>
   <h5 class="desc"><strong>How long does the contract last?</strong></h5>
   <div class="content-faq">
   In most cases, the contract duration is one year, and it will be renewed automatically on an annual basis. However, both your company and Satuplatform can terminate the contract via written communication, with a minimum of one month’s notice prior to the expiration date. It is also important to note that it is crucial to protect our client’s interests and their operational stability under the contract. Therefore, we require you to fulfill your product offering through the expiration date of the contract that we have with existing client.
